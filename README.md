# ShopEase Admin Dashboard

ShopEase is an admin dashboard designed to simplify the management of e-commerce operations, providing a responsive and intuitive interface with essential features like real-time analytics, inventory management, and sales tracking. This dashboard is fully customizable, offering both light and dark themes, and a mobile-friendly design to ensure accessibility on various devices.

## Features

- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**: ShopEase offers a theme toggle feature that allows users to switch between a light and dark theme, enhancing the visual experience based on user preferences or ambient lighting conditions.

- **Fully Responsive Design**: The dashboard is built with a fully responsive layout, ensuring it adapts seamlessly to any screen size, from desktops to mobile devices. On smaller devices, a hamburger sidebar appears for easy navigation, ensuring that the interface remains clutter-free while still providing quick access to essential sections.

- **Three Main Sections**:
  
    - **Left Section (Sidebar)**: The left section acts as the main navigation hub. It contains links to different sections of the admin panel such as dashboard, analytics, inventory, orders, and more. On smaller screens,           this section can be toggled using a hamburger icon.
      
    - **Main Section (Middle)**: The middle section is the core content area where most of the dynamic data and widgets are displayed, such as sales charts, recent orders, and activity logs.
        Right Section: The right section provides additional information or widgets, like notifications, user activity, quick settings, or other important insights.

    - **Grid Layout**: The layout of these three sections is aligned using CSS Grid, which ensures proper positioning and scalability across different screen sizes, giving a clean and organized look to the dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the website.
 
- **CSS3**: For styling, including responsive design, themes, and layout using CSS Grid.
 
- **JavaScript**: For the theme toggle functionality, sidebar management, and other interactive elements.
  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website adapts smoothly to different device sizes with media queries and flexible layouts.
